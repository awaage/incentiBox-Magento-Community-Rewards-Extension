## Description:

The Magento social media login & incentiBox community rewards extension allows you to create a community rewards (loyalty) program and incentivize your store visitors to promote your brand and your products. The extension will display a widget that enables participants to sign in to your Magento store via Facebook account, and incentivizes your customers and store-visitors to "like" your Facebook page, and share your products with their friends via social media (Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and 300+ others). In return, your customers will receive store credit, redeemable only at your store!

Coupon codes are auto-generated, and will show up in the admin panel, so you can see how many coupons have been generated. Coupon codes and rewards program emails are customizable, as is the look and feel of the widget. The widget is collapsible, and can hover on the side of your store, to remind users to join your rewards program.

Example: Give participants a $5 off coupon when they share about your products with their social networks. You gain valuable word-of-mouth advertising for your Magento store, AND generate additional sales when participants and their friends redeem their store credit!

## Notes:
This extension has been tested with Magento 1.4 and greater. This extension interfaces with incentiBox, and communicates through the incentiBox API. For more information, and to sign up for incentiBox for API access, please see www.incentibox.com.
